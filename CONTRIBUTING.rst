Do you want to contribute to this project?  Great!  I’d love to see some help,
but you need to comply with some easy rules.

Issue reporting
===============

GitHub Issues are the best way to report an issue.  If you do not have an
account there, get one or mail me.

Code contributions
==================

Pythonista?  Great!  There are a few things you need to do first.

 * A GitHub account is mandatory.  Period.  Patches by mail are not accepted.
   Sorry.
 * Fork the repo and work on it.

And these are the rules used while writing code or commiting:

 * PEP 8.  `pip install pep8` may help you.
 * Commits should be logical.  Signoffs and long messages are welcome.  “fixes
   #xxx” is mandatory if an issue exists.
 * `./tests.py`.

Done?  Go hit the **Pull Request** button over on GitHub!  Your commit should
be pulled up in the next few moments.

The ones who want to localize, look at the localization guide, also part of the
documentation.
