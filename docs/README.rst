PURPOSE
-------
Building and installing AUR packages.

INSTALLATION
------------

There are two ways to install PKGBUILDer:

1. Get it from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pkgbuilder/
2. Add the PKGBUILDer unofficial repository: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#pkgbuilder

After adding the repository, you need to run::

    # pacman-key -r 5EAAEA16
    # pacman-key --lsign 5EAAEA16
    # pacman -Syyu

BASIC USAGE
-----------

``pkgbuilder`` is a command-line application.  It takes various options and
package names as arguments.  The following options are needed for basic usage:

* ``-S`` to work in /tmp instead of the current directory
* ``-F`` to fetch packages instead of installing them
* ``-s`` to search for packages in the AUR
* ``-i`` to get info about an AUR package
* ``-u`` to upgrade all AUR packages on your system

PKGBUILDer also comes with ``pb``, a wrapper that works with both pacman and
the AUR.

For more information, refer to the ``-h`` command, the ``pkgbuilder(8)`` man
page, or the online documentation at https://pkgbuilder.readthedocs.org/.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

PKGBUILDer supports per-user configuration, in the file
~/.config/kwpolska/pkgbuilder/pkgbuilder.ini.  It can also be configured on a
per-usage basis via command-line arguments.

SECURITY AND EDITING PKGBUILDs
------------------------------

By default, PKGBUILDer strives to be the no-questions-asked package manager.
This means that all packages are built immediately, without any confirmations.
The behavior can be overridden with the ``--edit-pkgbuild`` command-line
option, or with ``edit=pkgbuild=true`` in PKGBUILDer’s config file.
