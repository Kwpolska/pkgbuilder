SYNOPSIS
========

*pkgbuilder* [-hVcCdDvwy] [--debug|--nodebug] [--pgpcheck|--skippgpcheck] [--confirm|--noconfirm] [--deep|--shallow] [--userfetch USER] [-SFisuUX] [PACKAGE [PACKAGE ...]]

DESCRIPTION
===========

PKGBUILDer is an AUR helper, i.e. an application which builds AUR
packages.  It can be used in conjunction with pacman (with a special
script).  It uses various techniques to automatize the process as
much as possible.

Since version 2.1.0.0, PKGBUILDer provides modules that can be used in
other scripts.

Since version 2.1.5.6, PKGBUILDer also provides support for repository
packages.  Passing a repository package name to the ``-S`` option will result
in a seamless detection and build process.

Notice: Running PKGBUILDer and/or PBWrapper as root can deal catastrophic
damage to your system.  Run it as a regular user, you will be prompted for
the root password when one will be required (i.e. to run **pacman**).

CONFIGURATION
=============

PKGBUILDer supports per-user configuration, in the file
~/.config/kwpolska/pkgbuilder/pkgbuilder.ini.  It can also be configured on a
per-usage basis via command-line arguments.

OPERATIONS
==========

**-S, --sync**
    Build packages in */tmp* instead of CWD.  Override with ``--notmp``.

**-F, --fetch, -G, --get**
    Fetch (and don't build) **PACKAGE**\s in a fashion similar to
    ``cower -d``.  Override with ``--nofetch``.

**--userfetch USER**
    Fetch all AUR packages of an user.

**-y, --refresh**
    A dummy option for pacman syntax compatibility.

**-i, --info**
    Display info about **PACKAGE** in a fashion similar to pacman.

**-s, --search**
    Search the AUR for packages with **PACKAGE** as the query.

**-u, --sysupgrade**
    Check for package updates in the AUR.  If updates are found,
    they will be installed or fetched if the user accepts.  Pass twice to
    downgrade.

**-U, --upgrade**
    Move pacman packages to the cache and install them.

**-X, --runtx**
    Run transactions from *.tx* files.  (created as part of the install
    process, usable to re-run an installation if it fails)

Additionally, parameters **-S**, **--sync**, **-y** and **-refresh**
are accepted for pacman syntax compatibility. **-S**/**--sync**
makes the script build its packages in /tmp instead of the current
working directory (CWD).

OPTIONS
=======

Most option have a negated version, to temporarily override a config setting.
Only the non-default options are documented below.

**-h, --help**
    Show the help message.

**-V, --version**
    Show the version number.

**-c, --clean**
    Clean the build directory after a finished build. (*makepkg -c*)

**-C, --nocolors**
    Force the script to ignore the ANSI color codes.

**--debug**
    Output debug information to stderr.

**-d, --nodepcheck**
    Skip dependency checks.  It may (and, most likely, will)
    break makepkg.

**-D, --vcsupgrade**
    Upgrade all the VCS packages on the system.  Requires **-u**.

**-v, --novalidation**
    Skip package installation validation phase (checking
    if the package is installed).

**-w, --buildonly**
    Skip package installation after building.

**--skippgpcheck**
    Skip PGP checks.

**--noconfirm**
    Do not ask for confirmation when installing packages.

**--deep**
    Perform deep clones of git repositories.  Override with ``--shallow``.

**--edit-pkgbuild**
    Offer to edit PKGBUILDs before they are installed.

**--ignore [PACKAGE PACKAGE ...]**
    Ignore a package upgrade (can be used more than once, or use commas --
    follows pacman syntax)

**-y, --refresh**
    Dummy option for pacman compatibility.

SECURITY AND EDITING PKGBUILDs
==============================

By default, PKGBUILDer strives to be the no-questions-asked package manager.
This means that all packages are built immediately, without any confirmations.
The behavior can be overridden with the ``--edit-pkgbuild`` command-line
option, or with ``edit=pkgbuild=true`` in PKGBUILDer’s config file.

EXAMPLES
========

pkgbuilder hello
    Install the package hello from the AUR.  It will be built in
    the CWD.

pkgbuilder -S hello
    Install hello, but builds the package in /tmp/pkgbuilder-UID.

pkgbuilder -F hello
    Fetch the AUR git repository for hello to the CWD.

pkgbuilder -SF hello
    Like above, but does it in /tmp/pkgbuilder-UID.

pkgbuilder python
    Python is a binary repo package, triggering a package download from ASP.
    -S and/or -F/-G are also accepted.

pkgbuilder -Syu
    Check for updates and offer installing them.

pkgbuilder -uF
    Check for updates and offer fetching them.
