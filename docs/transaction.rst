To install built packages, PKGBUILDer uses transactions.  A transaction stores:

* package names (as requested by user), used for the validation step
* package file names, moved to pacman cache and installed through ``pacman -U``
* signature file names, moved to pacman cache
* options for running the transaction
* a reference to the transaction file name (if any; ``.tx`` files are autosaved when status changes occur)
* 

.. automodule:: pkgbuilder.transaction
