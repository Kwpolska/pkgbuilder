Versioning scheme
=================
PKGBUILDer uses the following versioning scheme:

    generation.major.minor.revision

 * generation: 1 is the first Perl version, 2 is the Python version.
 * major: basic release number.
 * minor: sub-release number.
 * revision: changes that aren’t important enough to be new minor versions.

Generation 2
============
:2.1.5.1: More tiny bugfixes.
:2.1.5.0: A release including the sample scripts, among other stuff.  This is a
          release which now has all the functionality I want it to have.  And
          it’s time to move onto a new project, the aurqt interface for the
          AUR.  Or maybe something else?
:2.1.4.7: Quite a lot of changes.
:2.1.4.5-2.1.4.6: Fixes some bugs.
:2.1.4.4: The mature release, including downrades, excluding mess.
:2.1.4.2-2.1.4.3:  Bug fixes, thanks to fosskers (from aura, another AUR
                   helper).
:2.1.4.1: Dropped the useless msgcodes, which made no sense at all.
:2.1.4.0: ``pb`` wrapper!
:2.1.3.7: depcheck ignores empty deps now.
:2.1.3.2-2.1.3.6: little, unimportant fixes, for docs and locale and whatnot.
:2.1.3.1: print_package_*
:2.1.3.0: Now divided into modules.
:2.1.2.33: Bugfix release, final release of 2.1.2 series.
:2.1.2.32: Test suite introduced.  (unittests, nosetests were used in the very
           beginning)
:2.1.2.31: The big changes begin.  Introducing requests.
:2.1.2.1-2.1.2.30: Tiny, unimportant bugfixes.

                   Somehow, my version numbering broke, and after .5 we got
                   .26.  There was something wrong with the thing, so I upped
                   it to be 26.  It was, of course, supposed to go further and
                   the 2 came over from the minor version.  Crazy.
:2.1.2.0: Support for the new pyalpm.
:2.1.1.8: Fixed the license.
:2.1.1.7: Some little changes.
:2.1.1.6: Fixed AUR dep detection.  (not released into git.)
:2.1.1.5: Some fixes for locale support.
:2.1.1.4: Locale support!
:2.1.1.0-2.1.1.3: Little changes and refinements.
:2.1.0: First OOP-based release.  Including: -Syu, BSD License, own AUR class,
        documentation, module usage-friendliness.
:2.1.0-prerelease: A prerelease build of 2.1.0.  This one still works with the
                   AUR class by Xyne.
:2.0: First release.

Generation 1
============

:1.1: A more advanced version, never released publicly, and I do not even have
      any backups.  Nobody cares anyways.
:1.0: First and only release.
